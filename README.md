| [SymCC](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-poeplau.pdf)  | [Usenix Security 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/) | "SymCC hooks into compilers and instruments target code at compile time..." The compiled program has built-in symbolic execution functionalities. Needs source code for programs.  |
